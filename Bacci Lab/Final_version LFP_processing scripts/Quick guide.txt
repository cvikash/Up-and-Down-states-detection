                                        A quick user guide for Up and Down scripts



1. In the beginning of the data analysis, the user must have a few whole-cell intracellular recordings (LFP on another channel).
   First, user should run the script 'vikash_intra_up_down.m'. Upon running this script, user will be asked to provide a .abf 
   file containing whole-cell intracellular recording on channel. After processing the provided data, this script will save
   some figures and original_.abf_filename_theta_X.txt file. In this text file, user can obtain theta values corresponding to
   the low frequency bands (variable name 'fbands') provided in beginning of this script. It is recommended that user do this 
   for some significant number of recordings, not just for 1 or 2. Based on the last two figures, histogram plot of phase of LFP 
   during Up and Down states and Lx(t) function, user can decide which bands provide phase preference for Up and Down state and
   for which Lx(t) fits well in a sine wave. 



2. After deciding which bands to use for state detection, user can go the script 'Spike_detect_In_vivo_UP_DOWN_States' and assign
   the variable 'bands' in line 147 to the ones that you have chosen from step 1 and variable 'theta' in line 148 to theta values
   of bands obtained from step 1 in the same order as the bands. Now the user is set to run the script 'Spike_detect_In_vivo_UP_DOWN_States'.
   Input arguments of this script are a *.abf file containing juxt recording on one channel and LFP recording on another, bandwidth
   you have chosen, minimum interval between states and minimum duration of a state. For a good detection, user can tweak these
   parameters based on qualitative analysis of LFP recording. Output of this script are several useful figures and info about periods
   of Up and Down states.
